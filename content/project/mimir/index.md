## 01 Intro
This project was a follow up to our work on [**Unreally**](https://github.com/VinceDerPrince). [**Vincent**]() and I wanted to build a new fact-checking method using state-of-the-art technologies like LangChain and the OpenAI davinci-003 model.

Our objectives:
1. Extract the key claims of a given text
2. Find relevant internet context and display it in natural language
3. Integrate everything in a web-app

## 02 Design
